Hello! I'm a PhD student in Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence at the [University of Udine](https://uniud.it), working with the [AILAB Udine](https://ailab.uniud.it).
My academic journey has also included a visiting research position at the Athens University of Economics and Business (AUEB) [NLP Group](http://nlp.cs.aueb.gr/).

My research is at the intersection of Deep Learning and the Digital Humanities. I build AI models to help restore, attribute and understand ancient inscriptions.

Outside of research, my interests in literature, fine art, piano, and cinema strongly complement my academic focus on cultural heritage. I also stay active and clear my head with running, cycling, and bouldering.

I'm always open to discussing research, collaborations, or new ideas. Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alessandro-locaputo-877248248) or see my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/alocaputo).
